**Prompt for Creating the "snake_case" Game**

Create a complete Python game called "snake_case" using the Pygame library, designed to run in a Pyodide environment for web compatibility. The game is a clicker-style game where multiple colored snakes operate as automatons, making autonomous decisions, while the player observes and can purchase additional snakes. The game includes a main menu, collision mechanics between snakes, and a scoring system. Below are the detailed requirements:

### General Requirements
- **Language and Library**: Use Python with Pygame for graphics and game logic. Ensure compatibility with Pyodide for web-based execution, avoiding dependencies or features not supported by Pyodide (e.g., avoid Pygame's sound module unless confirmed compatible).
- **Window Size**: Set the game window to 800x600 pixels.
- **Grid-Based Movement**: The game operates on a grid where each cell is 20x20 pixels, resulting in a 40x30 grid (800/20 = 40 columns, 600/20 = 30 rows).
- **Frame Rate**: Cap the game at 10 FPS to control snake movement speed.
- **Game States**: Implement three states: MENU (main menu), PLAYING (gameplay), and GAME_OVER (game over screen).

### Game Features
1. **Snake Mechanics**:
   - **Multiple Snakes**: The game starts with one snake, and the player can purchase additional snakes (up to a maximum of 10 for performance).
   - **Colors**: Each snake has a unique color from a predefined list (e.g., Red: (255, 0, 0), Green: (0, 255, 0), Blue: (0, 0, 255), Yellow: (255, 255, 0)).
   - **Automaton Behavior**: Snakes move autonomously using a simple AI:
     - Snakes prioritize moving toward the nearest food item using Manhattan distance.
     - If no food is reachable or to avoid collisions, snakes choose a random safe direction (up, down, left, right).
     - Avoid immediate collisions with walls and other snakes by checking the next position.
   - **Movement**: Snakes move one grid cell per frame in their current direction (up: (0, -1), down: (0, 1), left: (-1, 0), right: (1, 0)).
   - **Body Growth**: When a snake eats food, its body grows by one segment, and its score increases by 1.
   - **Collisions**:
     - **Self-Collision**: If a snake’s head collides with its own body, it dies.
     - **Snake-to-Snake Collision**: If a snake’s head collides with another snake’s body or head, it dies.
     - **Wall Collision**: If a snake hits the grid boundary (x < 0, x >= 40, y < 0, y >= 30), it dies.
     - Dead snakes are removed from the game, and their score is added to the player’s total currency.

2. **Food Mechanics**:
   - Food spawns randomly on the grid, ensuring it does not overlap with any snake’s body.
   - At least one food item is always present. When eaten, a new food spawns immediately.
   - Optionally, spawn additional food (up to 5 total) based on the number of active snakes to ensure sufficient food availability.
   - Food is drawn as a 20x20 pixel square with a distinct color (e.g., white: (255, 255, 255)).

3. **Clicker Mechanics**:
   - **Currency**: The player earns currency equal to the score of each snake when it dies (e.g., a snake with 5 segments earns 5 currency upon death).
   - **Purchasing Snakes**:
     - The player can buy a new snake for a fixed cost (e.g., 10 currency units).
     - New snakes spawn at a random grid position with a random color and direction, ensuring no overlap with existing snakes or food.
     - Limit the total number of snakes to 10 to maintain performance.
   - The player does not control the snakes directly but can influence the game by adding more snakes.

4. **Game Menu**:
   - **Main Menu (MENU state)**:
     - Display the game title "snake_case" in a large font (e.g., 48pt).
     - Include a "Start Game" button (clickable rectangle or text) to transition to the PLAYING state.
     - Include a "Quit" button to exit the game (in Pyodide, this could close the canvas or stop execution).
   - **Gameplay UI (PLAYING state)**:
     - Display the player’s total currency in the top-left corner (e.g., "Currency: 50").
     - Display a "Buy Snake" button in the top-right corner, showing the cost (e.g., "Buy Snake (10)").
     - Show the number of active snakes (e.g., "Snakes: 3/10").
     - If the player has insufficient currency, disable or gray out the "Buy Snake" button.
   - **Game Over Screen (GAME_OVER state)**:
     - Display when all snakes are dead or the player has no currency to buy more snakes.
     - Show the total currency earned and the high score (highest total currency achieved across sessions).
     - Include a "Restart" button to reset the game (clear snakes, reset currency to 0, spawn one snake) and return to PLAYING.
     - Include a "Back to Menu" button to return to the MENU state.

5. **Graphics and Rendering**:
   - **Background**: Use a black background (0, 0, 0).
   - **Snakes**: Draw each snake segment as a 20x20 pixel square in its assigned color.
   - **Food**: Draw food as a 20x20 pixel white square.
   - **UI Elements**: Use Pygame’s font rendering for text (e.g., currency, snake count, buttons). Ensure fonts are basic (e.g., "arial" or default Pygame font) for Pyodide compatibility.
   - **Buttons**: Draw buttons as rectangles with text labels, changing color on hover (e.g., gray to light gray).

### Technical Requirements
- **Class Structure**:
  - **Snake Class**: Manages each snake’s state (body segments, direction, color, score, alive status). Include methods for movement, collision detection, and eating food.
  - **Game Class**: Manages the overall game state, including:
    - List of snakes and food positions.
    - Player currency and high score.
    - Game state (MENU, PLAYING, GAME_OVER).
    - Methods for spawning food, handling snake purchases, and updating game logic.
- **Event Handling**:
  - Handle mouse clicks for menu buttons and the "Buy Snake" button.
  - Handle the window close event to gracefully exit (in Pyodide, ensure cleanup is compatible).
- **Game Loop**:
  - Use a main loop with a 10 FPS clock.
  - In the PLAYING state, update all snakes’ positions, check collisions, and spawn food as needed.
  - Render the appropriate screen based on the game state.
- **Pyodide Compatibility**:
  - Avoid file I/O for saving high scores (store in memory for the session).
  - Use `asyncio` for the main loop to ensure compatibility with Pyodide’s event loop (e.g., `asyncio.ensure_future` for game updates).
  - Test rendering and input handling in a Pyodide environment to ensure no unsupported features are used.

### Additional Notes
- **Balancing**: Adjust the snake purchase cost (e.g., 10 currency) and food spawn rate to ensure the game feels rewarding but challenging. For example, more snakes increase collision risk, so food should be plentiful enough to sustain growth.
- **Performance**: Cap the number of snakes at 10 and optimize collision detection (e.g., use a set for food and snake body positions) to maintain smooth performance in Pyodide.
- **Error Handling**: Include basic error checking (e.g., ensure new snakes/food spawn in valid positions, handle edge cases like no valid moves for a snake).
- **Optional Enhancements** (if time permits):
  - Add a visual effect when a snake dies (e.g., flash the screen or highlight the snake).
  - Display individual snake scores above their heads during gameplay.
  - Allow the player to upgrade snake AI (e.g., better food-seeking behavior) for additional currency.

### Deliverable
Provide a single Python file (`snake_case.py`) that implements the complete game, including all required features. Include comments explaining key sections (e.g., snake AI, collision detection, menu handling). Ensure the code is clean, modular, and compatible with Pyodide for web execution. Test the game to confirm it runs smoothly, with functional menus, autonomous snake behavior, and clicker mechanics.
